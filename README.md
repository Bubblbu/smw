# Scholarly Metadata Workshop

This was a short talk presented at the Scholarly Communications Lab on April 3, 2023.

The talk was organized into two parts:

- What is scholarly metadata and how could *provenance debt* as a concept help to approach it as a beginner?
- Tips on working with scholarly metadata

You can find the slides used for the talk [here](slides/smw_talk.ipynb), and a seperate slideshow on provenance debt [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cQoPxYi49n4GuEHsxayrtj3S74BVRrlqRenYpteAIts/edit?usp=sharing).

In the discussion, the idea came up to create a realistic example of a minimal script that might be used in bibliometric research. You can find those materials in the [code-example](code-example/) folder.

## Real-world example

> Hello *\*name\**!

You're obviously confused but reluctantly stay to listen to the stranger who quite rudely refers to you as \*name\*...

> Congratulations on being selected as one of the research fellows at the prestigous Centre of Bibliometrics Research Excellency. Over the next few weeks, you will learn the in and outs of scholarly communication and the quantitative study of science. Here comes your very first task without any further instructions:

Wait, what? You don't remember applying for any weird scholarships or summer schools. Those gruesome days of grad school lie in a long-distant past. This can't be happening. Not again...

> Senior researchers at our institute have conceptually outlined a novel article-level metric to measure impact, quality, and novelty of research. We are suspecting that the best papers are produced by authors whose names contain certain letter frequencies. To test our hypothesis, we need you to collect relevant metadata for the provided list of DOIs and extract the most common letters and journal title for each article.

You just tried to leave but every door seems to lead back into this room with the creepy academic. Your instincts are screaming and telling you to run but you still remember from last time... You already made it out once and you know that you can leave academia once again. But you need to stay calm and focused.

> Reward: 3 course credits

The tenured professor finally glitches away into his office and you're left with your laptop and a printed version of the Python documentation.

### Credits

I want to thank my ADHD for providing the nervous energy and urge to procrastinate which made this undertaking possible. Unfortunately...

Use whatever you want and if you let me know I'll probably be happy.
